This is a great addition to the neighborhood. The vibe here is so warm and welcoming.  They've got cool bathrooms downstairs in the basement and a station where you wash your hands(kinda weird but cool) + gender neutral! There's a station on the first floor in the middle of the dining area where they make tacos in front of you??? (I think so, but no1 was sitting there at the moment).  I thought that was really cool. They also have complimentary sparking water + water brought to your table in two large glass pitchers.  + service was great here! Waiter knew what was going on and could guide us in the right direction for the TOP selections on the menu. I ate the Pozole De Pollo!  -- it was good but too much corn for me.  It's also not the corn we're used to in America. I believe it's a Mexican corn, which is harder and not sweet.  (HOWEVER! the stew..  AMAZEBALLS).I believe the entire menu is ... A GO! (aka yes, place your order with confidence that it'll be delicious no matter what you choose.)Definitely recommend you to stop by.  They're drinks are also *thumbs up*
Rosie's is fun and clean.  The atmosphere is lively.   Situated on a corner there are two walls of glass doors.    There is plenty of light and greet views of everyone out on the street.  The servers are friendly and fun.   And, the food is really tasty and comes out hot.
They have delicious guacamole and corn tortilla chips!The guacamole was a bit spicy so it was a nice appetizer. It's not completely mashed, so I could still get some avocado chunks. It also came with two sauces, a sweet one like bbq sauce and a little bit spicy one. However, I don't think the sauces went well with the guac. They kinda took away the avocado taste. The chips were housemade and seasoned with just enough salt. The main dish, Huevos Ahogados, was two poached eggs in a kale mushroom soup. Eggs were perfectly cooked. The soup was very sour (I didn't like sour soup very much), but it was delicious when mixed with the egg yolks. The mushrooms were delicious in the soup.My friend ordered a few tacos, and Hongos, the mushroom taco, was the best. He ordered two more at the end. They offered free sparkling water and lemons, along with tap water, which was a plus for a restaurant of this price level.
My friend back in college came on assignment from Japan and we planned to catch up at a different Mexican restaurant originally. But when we passed by Rosie's, we were amazed by its beautiful outdoor seating and decided to give it a shot. While we were waiting for our food, SAM SMITH with his partner passed by us out of blue. My first celebrity come-across ever, coincidently!!!That aside, Rosie's had really delicious pork sandwich, or Torta de Carnitas, which the waitress told me is a traditional Mexican sandwich. The hand-pulled pork meet was so tender and juicy and was marinated nicely that went well with the chewy bread. Although it was a little greasy, it was the yummy part. The Tlayuda Oaxaquena was not bad, but the tortilla was a bit dry, especially when it got cold, the tortilla totally became stale. I've had better tortilla that, even when it's cold, it still can keep the texture.  We share the Citrica Salad that our waitress recommended, but I don't think it's worth the $12. Nothing special or surprisingly good; it was just a plate of grape fruits and pineapples with some lettuce. We each also ordered a margarita, Watermelon for my friend and Rosie's for me, but  mine took like 15 mins because the bartender forgot our order. The waitress was very nice and kept apologizing, but both our drinks were okay. For $12 or $14, I've had better so I think you can skip those two. Another negative thing is, they don't have complementary nachos and guacamole and cost you $7 :(If the weather is nice, come and try their Sorta de Carnitas. Anything else, it is up to you.
Great fish tacos, amazing and creative Mexican brunch options, which includes a. Moody Maria (made with tequila instead of vodka), and a friendly/knowledgeable staff.One of my favorite places in nyc for Mexican (probably my favorite).
A bit overrated. we waited almost 2 hours on a Wednesday and when we finally got seated we ordered asap and we we're pretty disappointed. Everything looked delicious and was Instagram worthy. But it lacked in flavors. One thing they got right was the drinks. They were pretty strong which is probably the reason why people like this place to begin with.
Very good pour-over coffee($3.5 Brooklyn Roasting Co.) and tacos.Brunch dishes were pretty good but nothing extraordinary.
This place was so trendy yet cute and chill. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and this place definitely hit the spot. Our waitress was a doll and was very attentive. Their drinks were delicious and strong. I got a few skinny margaritas. Pescado tacos were great, guacamole and pascado ala plancha was delicious and also had a beautiful display. If you're a vegetarian, they have a lot of vegetarian options. I highly recommend this place!
I came to Rosie's for dinner because everyone raved about how it's one of the best Mexican restaurants in New York and I definitely see why! We were seated pretty quickly to our table. Rosie's also has great outdoor seating options, perfect for the summer. The staff was also really friendly, our waiter was attentive and kept checking on us but not too much that was felt rushed to leave.We ended up ordering the watermelon margaritas, fish, beef & chicken tacos ($4 each), corn and chips & salsa. Everything was amazing!! Only negative was the slightly high prices but totally worth it for the quality of the food!
Really enjoyed Rosie's.  The staff was very good.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere was just right.  I didn't like the margaritas as much as I thought I would, but the ceviche was fantastic.  Highly recommend the guacamole too!  Absolutely will come back next time I am in NYC.
Came for happy hour on a weekday, and had a good time. It is before 7p and only at the bar area. Note the bar area seats ~10!! So get there early. There were some drinks and food options which is awesome. One of the HH food  options are TACOS $5 for 2! Best deal in town and they were so delicious. These were loaded tacos with all types of protein, and also had one veggie option. We tried them all - all 5 options. My favorite surprisingly wasn't the fish - which was food, but I actually liked the flavors of the pork the most. The veggie one was flavorful but was just ok. Would come back  for HH / try dinner.
One of my favorite things to do is eat outside. Pair that with good Mexican food and it's a dream come true. Rosie's is where you want to be if you're craving something good and refreshing in the East Village. Here is what you need to know:1. Those tortillas are the real deal. I am pretty sure that these are some of the best tortillas you can get in Manhattan, and that translates into how good the tacos/quesadillas/etc. are. 2. The outside dining area and open floor to ceiling windows create this awesome atmosphere where you can really sit down and relax. 3. It's possible to take a larger party here. 4. The service is good. 5. The watermelon margarita is the perfect summer refreshment. Rosie's has claimed its place on my go-to list. It's worth trying and has some of the best Mexican food in the city. Aka it has this Californian's golden stamp of approval.
Definitely come here for the spicy margarita -- delicious! The food is just okay, as is all Mexican food in New York. Had the brunch kale and poached egg dish, and it was basically salsa soup served with tortillas. Weird. And this place is super expensive for Mexican food, but I supposed standard for NYC prices.Bartender had a bit of an icy personality, but server was nice. Took awhile for someone to get to us, but the food came our super quick after we ordered.They have outdoor seating and the ambiance is good for people watching when the weather is nice.
I cam for brunch with friends a few weekends ago and I had a great time. We made a reservation a few days before because it was a large party otherwise we would have never gotten in because it was packed at 1:15pm on a Saturday afternoon. For the table, we order pitchers of the classic margarita, guacamole, and queso fundido. Everything was really good especially the guacamole!For lunch, I ordered the al pastor taco and the shrimp taco. My favorite was the al pastor taco which is pork, pineapple, and avocado tomatillo salsa. I didn't really love the shrimp taco, it was too fishy for me which is weird because shrimp normally isn't fishy tasting.The atmosphere and décor is great and the service was amazing as well. I would definitely go back for drinks and appetizers!
This is the first Mexican place I went to eat in at NYC! I really enjoyed the experience esp with my church sisters! We had a reservation and the tables were all set up and ready! They were really nice and asked us a few times if we wanted chips and guacamole for starters. Refills were free (AWESOME!!) haha I was very glad about that.It was dim lighting, and toilets are downstairs, where everyone share same washing hand space! So don't be alarmed when you see males waiting on line with you haha. The chips and guacamole taste like normal, crunchy and the red salsa is spicy. Nothing too special.The pork taco  ( El Pastor ) was delicious! I like the lime flavor, the sauce was minimal, it was so satisfying after eating one taco. I also ordered a fish taco, which I enjoyed less because of the spicy creme slapped on top (was too much for me ) so I wiped some off. Didn't love the white veggie on top as well. The fried fish was crunchy and soft! The check was around 198$ for 9 people, and we paid for our bday girl. So total was around 20$ Worth the experience because of the people!Service was kind, patient, and joyful.Taco price is normal for NYC, 4$ for all of them except the shrimp 6$. We ordered a watermelon margarita which taste ok, didn't love the tequila taste. Thanks will come back for the tacos!
I went to Rosie's on the 4th of July simply because I wasn't going to let America's Independence Day distract me from the fact that it was still Taco Tuesday. One thing I can say after coming here is if you thought that you had been to this establishment before and did not 1. Order the Watermelon Margarita and 2. Order the Pescado tacos, you my friend have actually never been to Rosie's.  So try again. These two things will keep me coming back. Absolutely no regrets, and even after being full my taste buds still made me order more tacos. $4 for the best fish taco I have ever had and great pitcher deals.  See you soon Rosie.I highly recommend making a reservation online. Why wait any longer for those tacos?
This is always a great go-to Mexican spot for big or small groups. I especially like it in the summertime when its completely open windowed. I looove their guac and margs and love that you can usually get a reservation.
The hype is not real. After I was recommended by two different people I decided to give Rosie's a try.The restaurant was packed and it was chaos around the hostess station. They really need to work on that, I didn't know who checked in and who was waiting to be taken care of. I ended up accidentally skipping someone and felt like a jerk.We ended up getting seated at the taco bar, so that was super cool. I really enjoyed watching stuff being made. However, I'd recommend waiting for an actual table, it wasn't conducive to eating if you're like us and order a feast.We got the el pastor and the fish tacos. They need to put some kind of warning, the tacos were crazy spicy. I drank so much water trying to cool my mouth. It was unenjoyable spicy for me. For our main dish I got the chorizo fundido and my date went for the steak. Again the chorizo was also stupid spicy, I ended up just calling it quits on my meal. The steak was good. The vegetables that came with the steak was borderline comical. My date basically got a full onion with a few pieces of pepper and a undercooked shallot.Overall, I've had much better tacos elsewhere. I even went to another taco spot a few days later declaring i can't let this be my last taco experience. The service was slow but who could blame them, they were packed. Decor is very instagramable. Food was not enjoyable for me, sorry you can't have the default of your tacos be flaming hot and expect everyone to just love spice.TLDR: come for the instragram, not the food.
How the hell did I never come here until now?!First of all, the tacos literally stand on their own. For $4 a pop, they're generously loaded with meat and exploding with flavor. Secondly~ these corn tortillas are INSANE! Just one thin perfectly toasted tortilla can hold a heavy serving of meat and sauce beautifully. With a perfect taste and perfect stretch, these agile homemade tortillas automatically put these tacos in the lead of best tacos in NY! Guac and salsa with homemade chips were $12 and a crunchy harbinger of flavor for the amazing tacos to come! David, our awesome server was a sweetheart and gave me a couple tortillas to go when I told him how impressed I was by their stamina :)
This is just the best food I have ever had and what made it worth while was the tortillas being made fresh.The guacamole was zesty and spot on. The pescado taco is addictive, you only get one per order but you can eat 4 or 5 to satisfy you. I wouldnt order the  pitcher of watermelon margarita but the glass was spot on.
This is a great addition to the neighborhood. The vibe here is so warm and welcoming.  They've got cool bathrooms downstairs in the basement and a station where you wash your hands(kinda weird but cool) + gender neutral! There's a station on the first floor in the middle of the dining area where they make tacos in front of you??? (I think so, but no1 was sitting there at the moment).  I thought that was really cool. They also have complimentary sparking water + water brought to your table in two large glass pitchers.  + service was great here! Waiter knew what was going on and could guide us in the right direction for the TOP selections on the menu. I ate the Pozole De Pollo!  -- it was good but too much corn for me.  It's also not the corn we're used to in America. I believe it's a Mexican corn, which is harder and not sweet.  (HOWEVER! the stew..  AMAZEBALLS).I believe the entire menu is ... A GO! (aka yes, place your order with confidence that it'll be delicious no matter what you choose.)Definitely recommend you to stop by.  They're drinks are also *thumbs up*

The service is good. 5. The watermelon margarita is the perfect summer refreshment. Rosie's has claimed its place on my go-to list. It's worth trying and has some of the best Mexican food in the city. Aka it has this Californian's golden stamp of approval.
Definitely come here for the spicy margarita -- delicious! The food is just okay, as is all Mexican food in New York. Had the brunch kale and poached egg dish, and it was basically salsa soup served with tortillas. Weird. And this place is super expensive for Mexican food, but I supposed standard for NYC prices.Bartender had a bit of an icy personality, but server was nice. Took awhile for someone to get to us, but the food came our super quick after we ordered.They have outdoor seating and the ambiance is good for people watching when the weather is nice.
I cam for brunch with friends a few weekends ago and I had a great time. We made a reservation a few days before because it was a large party otherwise we would have never gotten in because it was packed at 1:15pm on a Saturday afternoon. For the table, we order pitchers of the classic margarita, guacamole, and queso fundido. Everything was really good especially the guacamole!For lunch, I ordered the al pastor taco and the shrimp taco. My favorite was the al pastor taco which is pork, pineapple, and avocado tomatillo salsa. I didn't really love the shrimp taco, it was too fishy for me which is weird because shrimp normally isn't fishy tasting.The atmosphere and décor is great and the service was amazing as well. I would definitely go back for drinks and appetizers!
This is the first Mexican place I went to eat in at NYC! I really enjoyed the experience esp with my church sisters! We had a reservation and the tables were all set up and ready! They were really nice and asked us a few times if we wanted chips and guacamole for starters. Refills were free (AWESOME!!) haha I was very glad about that.It was dim lighting, and toilets are downstairs, where everyone share same washing hand space! So don't be alarmed when you see males waiting on line with you haha. The chips and guacamole taste like normal, crunchy and the red salsa is spicy. Nothing too special.The pork taco  ( El Pastor ) was delicious! I like the lime flavor, the sauce was minimal, it was so satisfying after eating one taco. I also ordered a fish taco, which I enjoyed less because of the spicy creme slapped on top (was too much for me ) so I wiped some off. Didn't love the white veggie on top as well. The fried fish was crunchy and soft! The check was around 198$ for 9 people, and we paid for our bday girl. So total was around 20$ Worth the experience because of the people!Service was kind, patient, and joyful.Taco price is normal for NYC, 4$ for all of them except the shrimp 6$. We ordered a watermelon margarita which taste ok, didn't love the tequila taste. Thanks will come back for the tacos!
I went to Rosie's on the 4th of July simply because I wasn't going to let America's Independence Day distract me from the fact that it was still Taco Tuesday. One thing I can say after coming here is if you thought that you had been to this establishment before and did not 1. Order the Watermelon Margarita and 2. Order the Pescado tacos, you my friend have actually never been to Rosie's.  So try again. These two things will keep me coming back. Absolutely no regrets, and even after being full my taste buds still made me order more tacos. $4 for the best fish taco I have ever had and great pitcher deals.  See you soon Rosie.I highly recommend making a reservation online. Why wait any longer for those tacos?
This is always a great go-to Mexican spot for big or small groups. I especially like it in the summertime when its completely open windowed. I looove their guac and margs and love that you can usually get a reservation.
The hype is not real. After I was recommended by two different people I decided to give Rosie's a try.The restaurant was packed and it was chaos around the hostess station. They really need to work on that, I didn't know who checked in and who was waiting to be taken care of. I ended up accidentally skipping someone and felt like a jerk.We ended up getting seated at the taco bar, so that was super cool. I really enjoyed watching stuff being made. However, I'd recommend waiting for an actual table, it wasn't conducive to eating if you're like us and order a feast.We got the el pastor and the fish tacos. They need to put some kind of warning, the tacos were crazy spicy. I drank so much water trying to cool my mouth. It was unenjoyable spicy for me. For our main dish I got the chorizo fundido and my date went for the steak. Again the chorizo was also stupid spicy, I ended up just calling it quits on my meal. The steak was good. The vegetables that came with the steak was borderline comical. My date basically got a full onion with a few pieces of pepper and a undercooked shallot.Overall, I've had much better tacos elsewhere. I even went to another taco spot a few days later declaring i can't let this be my last taco experience. The service was slow but who could blame them, they were packed. Decor is very instagramable. Food was not enjoyable for me, sorry you can't have the default of your tacos be flaming hot and expect everyone to just love spice.TLDR: come for the instragram, not the food.
How the hell did I never come here until now?!First of all, the tacos literally stand on their own. For $4 a pop, they're generously loaded with meat and exploding with flavor. Secondly~ these corn tortillas are INSANE! Just one thin perfectly toasted tortilla can hold a heavy serving of meat and sauce beautifully. With a perfect taste and perfect stretch, these agile homemade tortillas automatically put these tacos in the lead of best tacos in NY! Guac and salsa with homemade chips were $12 and a crunchy harbinger of flavor for the amazing tacos to come! David, our awesome server was a sweetheart and gave me a couple tortillas to go when I told him how impressed I was by their stamina :)
This is just the best food I have ever had and what made it worth while was the tortillas being made fresh.The guacamole was zesty and spot on. The pescado taco is addictive, you only get one per order but you can eat 4 or 5 to satisfy you. I wouldnt order the  pitcher of watermelon margarita but the glass was spot on.
This is a great addition to the neighborhood. The vibe here is so warm and welcoming.  They've got cool bathrooms downstairs in the basement and a station where you wash your hands(kinda weird but cool) + gender neutral! There's a station on the first floor in the middle of the dining area where they make tacos in front of you??? (I think so, but no1 was sitting there at the moment).  I thought that was really cool. They also have complimentary sparking water + water brought to your table in two large glass pitchers.  + service was great here! Waiter knew what was going on and could guide us in the right direction for the TOP selections on the menu. I ate the Pozole De Pollo!  -- it was good but too much corn for me.  It's also not the corn we're used to in America. I believe it's a Mexican corn, which is harder and not sweet.  (HOWEVER! the stew..  AMAZEBALLS).I believe the entire menu is ... A GO! (aka yes, place your order with confidence that it'll be delicious no matter what you choose.)Definitely recommend you to stop by.  They're drinks are also *thumbs up*
Rosie's is fun and clean.  The atmosphere is lively.   Situated on a corner there are two walls of glass doors.    There is plenty of light and greet views of everyone out on the street.  The servers are friendly and fun.   And, the food is really tasty and comes out hot.
They have delicious guacamole and corn tortilla chips!The guacamole was a bit spicy so it was a nice appetizer. It's not completely mashed, so I could still get some avocado chunks. It also came with two sauces, a sweet one like bbq sauce and a little bit spicy one. However, I don't think the sauces went well with the guac. They kinda took away the avocado taste. The chips were housemade and seasoned with just enough salt. The main dish, Huevos Ahogados, was two poached eggs in a kale mushroom soup. Eggs were perfectly cooked. The soup was very sour (I didn't like sour soup very much), but it was delicious when mixed with the egg yolks. The mushrooms were delicious in the soup.My friend ordered a few tacos, and Hongos, the mushroom taco, was the best. He ordered two more at the end. They offered free sparkling water and lemons, along with tap water, which was a plus for a restaurant of this price level.
My friend back in college came on assignment from Japan and we planned to catch up at a different Mexican restaurant originally. But when we passed by Rosie's, we were amazed by its beautiful outdoor seating and decided to give it a shot. While we were waiting for our food, SAM SMITH with his partner passed by us out of blue. My first celebrity come-across ever, coincidently!!!That aside, Rosie's had really delicious pork sandwich, or Torta de Carnitas, which the waitress told me is a traditional Mexican sandwich. The hand-pulled pork meet was so tender and juicy and was marinated nicely that went well with the chewy bread. Although it was a little greasy, it was the yummy part. The Tlayuda Oaxaquena was not bad, but the tortilla was a bit dry, especially when it got cold, the tortilla totally became stale. I've had better tortilla that, even when it's cold, it still can keep the texture.  We share the Citrica Salad that our waitress recommended, but I don't think it's worth the $12. Nothing special or surprisingly good; it was just a plate of grape fruits and pineapples with some lettuce. We each also ordered a margarita, Watermelon for my friend and Rosie's for me, but  mine took like 15 mins because the bartender forgot our order. The waitress was very nice and kept apologizing, but both our drinks were okay. For $12 or $14, I've had better so I think you can skip those two. Another negative thing is, they don't have complementary nachos and guacamole and cost you $7 :(If the weather is nice, come and try their Sorta de Carnitas. Anything else, it is up to you.
Great fish tacos, amazing and creative Mexican brunch options, which includes a. Moody Maria (made with tequila instead of vodka), and a friendly/knowledgeable staff.One of my favorite places in nyc for Mexican (probably my favorite).
A bit overrated. we waited almost 2 hours on a Wednesday and when we finally got seated we ordered asap and we we're pretty disappointed. Everything looked delicious and was Instagram worthy. But it lacked in flavors. One thing they got right was the drinks. They were pretty strong which is probably the reason why people like this place to begin with.
Very good pour-over coffee($3.5 Brooklyn Roasting Co.) and tacos.Brunch dishes were pretty good but nothing extraordinary.
This place was so trendy yet cute and chill. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and this place definitely hit the spot. Our waitress was a doll and was very attentive. Their drinks were delicious and strong. I got a few skinny margaritas. Pescado tacos were great, guacamole and pascado ala plancha was delicious and also had a beautiful display. If you're a vegetarian, they have a lot of vegetarian options. I highly recommend this place!
I came to Rosie's for dinner because everyone raved about how it's one of the best Mexican restaurants in New York and I definitely see why! We were seated pretty quickly to our table. Rosie's also has great outdoor seating options, perfect for the summer. The staff was also really friendly, our waiter was attentive and kept checking on us but not too much that was felt rushed to leave.We ended up ordering the watermelon margaritas, fish, beef & chicken tacos ($4 each), corn and chips & salsa. Everything was amazing!! Only negative was the slightly high prices but totally worth it for the quality of the food!
Really enjoyed Rosie's.  The staff was very good.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere was just right.  I didn't like the margaritas as much as I thought I would, but the ceviche was fantastic.  Highly recommend the guacamole too!  Absolutely will come back next time I am in NYC.
Came for happy hour on a weekday, and had a good time. It is before 7p and only at the bar area. Note the bar area seats ~10!! So get there early. There were some drinks and food options which is awesome. One of the HH food  options are TACOS $5 for 2! Best deal in town and they were so delicious. These were loaded tacos with all types of protein, and also had one veggie option. We tried them all - all 5 options. My favorite surprisingly wasn't the fish - which was food, but I actually liked the flavors of the pork the most. The veggie one was flavorful but was just ok. Would come back  for HH / try dinner.
One of my favorite things to do is eat outside. Pair that with good Mexican food and it's a dream come true. Rosie's is where you want to be if you're craving something good and refreshing in the East Village. Here is what you need to know:1. Those tortillas are the real deal. I am pretty sure that these are some of the best tortillas you can get in Manhattan, and that translates into how good the tacos/quesadillas/etc. are. 2. The outside dining area and open floor to ceiling windows create this awesome atmosphere where you can really sit down and relax. 3. It's possible to take a larger party here. 4. The service is good. 5. The watermelon margarita is the perfect summer refreshment. Rosie's has claimed its place on my go-to list. It's worth trying and has some of the best Mexican food in the city. Aka it has this Californian's golden stamp of approval.
